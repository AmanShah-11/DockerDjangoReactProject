<h1>Species Prediction Model</h1>

<p>I built this application to gain some insight into using Redux and building a full stack app to predict a species type based on its dimensions using a machine learning model  </p>

<p>The application takes in information from sliders and uses the machine learning model to predict the species</p>

<p>In order to have access to the APIs for the machine learning model, you must login to your account (access to APIs are restricted to authenticated users). </p>

<p> Users have the option to change their password in the password change endpoint.</p>

<p> The backend for this was built in Python and Django, while the frontend was made in React and Redux </p>

<p>The tools/technologies that I used include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Python</li>
    <li>Django</li>
    <li>React </li>
    <li>Redux</li>
</ul>

Here are some screenshots of how the application looks!
